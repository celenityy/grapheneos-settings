# grapheneos-settings

My recommendations for the ultimate GrapheneOS Configuration :)

**NOTE:** This project can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celenity/grapheneos-settings), which will act as the main & preferred way to contribute, and [GitHub](https://github.com/celenityy/grapheneos-settings).

<br>

**Attestation key provisioning** -> `GrapheneOS proxy` *(Should be default)*

**Widevine provisoning** -> `GrapheneOS proxy` *(Should be default)*

# Connected devices

Connection preferences:

* Bluetooth -> **Use Bluetooth** -> ❌ *when not using*

* **Ultra-Wideband (UWB)** -> ❌ *(You will need to temporarily turn off Airplane Mode to toggle this option, don't forget to enable Airplane Mode again after)*

# Apps

Go through all apps and remove permissions that are unneeded

I would also recommend removing the `Sensors` permission from `Apps`, `Calculator`, `Clock`, `Contacts`, `Files`, `Gallery`, `Keyboard`, `Messaging`, `PDF Viewer`, `Vanadium`, & `Vanadium System WebView` *(For `Vanadium System WebView` to appear, you must select the 3 dots on the top right corner and select `Show system`)

**App battery usage** -> This is a great option to take advantage of, I would recommend disabling background usage for any apps that don't need to run in the background, as this can heavily improve battery life & privacy. You can also allow unrestricted access here to any apps that do need to run in the background, like Signal or Molly without Google Play.

**Special app access** -> Go through the options here and make sure nothing is granted any of these permissions that doesn't 100% need it

Special app access -> **Special access to hardware accelerators for Google apps** -> `Access not granted` ❌

# Notifications

**App notifications** -> Go through and disable notifications for any apps that don't need it

Notification history -> **Use notification history** -> ❌ *(Should be default)*

**Battery share** -> ❌

# Display

**Dark theme** -> ✅

Night Light -> **Schedule** -> `Turns on at custom time`

Night Light -> **Start time** -> `9:00 PM`

Night Light -> **End time** -> `6:00 AM`

# Accessibility

Please do **NOT** grant any apps the accessibility permission unless you actually need to. This is a very dangerous permission, very concerning from a privacy & security stand-point, so please be mindful.

# Security

**Screen lock** -> I would recomend using a strong `Password` and avoiding fingerprint, face, or PIN if possible.

Screen lock -> **Lock after screen timeout** -> Your choice, the lower the better, I leave mine at `5 seconds after timeout`

Screen lock -> **Power button instantly locks** -> ✅

**Auto reboot** -> Your choice, the lower the better, I leave mine at `8 hours`

**Duress password** -> This is a great setting, make sure to enable and take advantage of it.

**USB-C port** -> `Charging-only when locked` *(If you don't use any USB devices at all with your device, you should set this to `Charging-only`)*

Secure app spawning -> **Use secure app spawning** -> `Enabled` ✅

**Automatic exploit protection compatibility mode** -> ❌ *(If you're not willing to troubleshoot the very rare times an app has issues, then you could potentially leave this on)*

Native code debugging -> **Block for third-party apps by default** -> ✅

**Scramble PIN input layout** -> ✅

**Allow camera access when the device is locked** -> ❌

**Notify about system process crashes** -> ✅

More security settings:

Location services -> **Bluetooth scanning** -> ❌ *(Should be default, make sure to also set for your `Work` profile if you have one)*

SUPL is used to speed-up acquiring location, but it comes at the cost of potentially sending sensitive information to Google, such as your MCC, MNC, nearby cell towers, and the strength of those towers. While GrapheneOS does proxy this connection, which helps to improve privacy, this is still not ideal, as Google is still sent this data. I have personally not noticed any difference acquiring location with this off, so as long as you're on a newer Pixel, I would highly recommend just disabling this. You can read more about SUPL, as well as PSDS [here](https://divestos.org/misc/gnss.txt):

**Secure User Plane Location (SUPL)** -> `Off`

**Predicted Satellite Data Service (PSDS)** -> `GrapheneOS server` *(harmless)*
